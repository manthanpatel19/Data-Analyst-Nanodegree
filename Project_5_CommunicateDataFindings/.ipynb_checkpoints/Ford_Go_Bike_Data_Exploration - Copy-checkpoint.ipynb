    "> From the above analysis of the Ford GoBike data, we can say that most of the rentals are around 500 seconds and very few above 3000 seconds. A very few number of users are also seen booking the bike for long hours. Moreover, the service can be seen availed from San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose in California. San Francisco has the highest number of users (around 75%) followed by Oakland (with 20%) and finally San Jose (with 5%). Most rentals happen around the peak hours of 7AM to 9AM and in the evening around 4PM to 6PM and are more during the weekdays than on weekends. But this relationship is stronger for San Francisco and is weaker in Oakland and is weakest in San Jose. It can be seen that most users of the Ford GoBike services are Subscribers and a very few are irregular customers. The subscribers use the services primarily during peak hours and on weekdays, thus supporting the statement made above. Irregular customers on the other hand use the services more during weekends and also during odd hours. Surprisingly though, on the other hand, San Francisco has a higher percentage of irregular customers using the rental service than subscribers in comparison to the Oakland and San Jose area. But due to the sheer number of users in San Francisco, the overall usage statistics is maintained. Another interesting diversion from usual stats can be seen in San Jose, where the subscribers are seen using the service throughout the day and not only during peak hours. "
