    "> The Ford GoBike System Data contains the Bay Wheels's trip data which includes information such as Trip Duration, Start Time, End Time,Station IDs, Bike ID and so on. After cleaning the data and storing it in a pandas dataframe, we can see that we have 184,086 entries of trips. These trips have the following features available:\n",
    "<br>Trip Duration (seconds) - numeric continunous\n",
    "<br>Start Time and Date - numeric continuous(datetime)\n",
    "<br>End Time and Date - numeric continuous(datetime)\n",
    "<br>Start Station ID - categorical (nominal)\n",
    "<br>Start Station Name - categorical (nominal)\n",
    "<br>Start Station Latitude - numeric\n",
    "<br>Start Station Longitude - numeric\n",
    "<br>End Station ID - categorical (nominal)\n",
    "<br>End Station Name - categorical (nominal)\n",
    "<br>End Station Latitude - numeric\n",
    "<br>End Station Longitude - numeric\n",
    "<br>Bike ID - categorical (nominal)\n",
    "<br>User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual) - categorical (nominal)\n",
    "<br>Bike Share for All (Bay Area residents who qualify for CalFresh, SFMTA Lifeline Pass, or PG&E CARE utility discount are eligible to join our **Bike Share for All program** for 5 dollars for the first year) - categorical (nominal)\n",
    "<br><br> The data has been taken from  https://s3.amazonaws.com/baywheels-data/index.html and **201911-baywheels-tripdata.csv.zip** is used for analysis.\n",

    "## Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Findings on the distributions of variables of interest (univariate explorations). \n",
    "> The conclusions from the explorations of individual variables are mentioned below:\n",
    "<br> 1) Most of the rentals are around 500 seconds and very few above 3000 seconds.\n",
    "<br> 2) Most rentals happen around the peak hours of 7AM to 9AM and in the evening around 4PM to 6PM\n",
    "<br> 3) Rentals are higher during the weekdays and less in the weekends\n",
    "<br> 4) 77% of users are subscribers and only 23% are irregular customers\n",
    "<br> 5) Only 7% of users have availed the \"Bike share for all\" program.\n",
    "<br> 6) Most users are from the San Francisco bay area and a sizeable users from the Oakland and San Jose area too.\n",
    "<br> <br>The distributions of the various variables were in most cases as expected. However, we saw a couple of cases where we saw some anamolies such as the duration of the rental which had a couple of entries in the extreme right end. Thus we plotted the values on the logarithmetic scale as well to understand the distribution well. Also, one more interesting thing to see is the rise in number of rentals on Fridays.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Findings from the bivariate explorations:\n",
    "> From our above explorations of 2 variables with each other, the findings are mentioned below:\n",
    "<br> 1) Longer rental durations are more common during weekends than on weekdays\n",
    "<br> 2) Longer rentals are more common around 10Am to 2PM\n",
    "<br> 3) Higher count of rentals during weekdays are during the peak hours (7AM to 9AM and 4PM to 6PM) and higher counts of rentals during weekends are in the afternoon around 12PM\n",
    "<br> 4) The rentals near the bay area are lesser during weekends but, the rental in the Oakland area and San Jose are significantly less in weekends.\n",
    "<br> 5) Users in San Jose and Oakland area very seldom use the bike for over 3000 seconds\n",
    "<br> 6) Subscribers usually use the bike for regular commute which is less than 3000 seconds. The irregular customers contribute to longer rental times\n",
    "<br> 7) Subscribers use the bikes mostly during rush hours and during weekdays, whereas the irregular customers are seen using bikes even during odd hours and more during weekends.\n",
    "<br> 8) Irregular customers are rare in the Oakland and San Jose areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Findings from multivariate explorations:\n",
    "\n",
    "> From the above explorations, we can say,\n",
    "<br> 1) San Francisco has most users during peak hours and in weekdays. Oakland follows a similar curve, but is not as drastic. Suprisingly, the users in San Jose dont necessarily use the rental services only during peak hours and weekdays.\n",
    "<br> 2) The ratio of subscribers over irregular customers in San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose are around 3.2, 3.7 and 6.42. This shows San Jose has very less number of irregular customers\n",
    "<br> 3) The duration of the rental service follows a narrower peak at around 500 seconds in during weekdays particularly in San Francisco, and the distribution gets a little more wider in weekends and as we move to Oakland. It is much more flattened at San Jose in comparison to the other two locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall Summary\n",
    "> From the analysis of the Ford GoBike data, we can say that most of the rentals are around 500 seconds and very few above 3000 seconds. Moreover, the service can be seen availed from San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose in California. San Francisco has the highest number of users (around 76%) followed by Oakland (with 19%) and finally San Jose (with 5%). Most rentals happen around the peak hours of 7AM to 9AM and 4PM to 6PM and are more during the weekdays than on weekends. But this relationship is stronger for San Francisco and is weaker in Oakland and is weakest in San Jose. It can be seen that most users are Subscribers and a very few are casual customers. The subscribers use the services primarily during peak hours and on weekdays, thus supporting the statement made above. Casual customers on the other hand use the services more during weekends and also during odd hours. Surprisingly though, San Francisco has a higher percentage of casual customers using the rental service than subscribers in comparison to the Oakland and San Jose area. But due to the sheer number of users in San Francisco, the overall usage statistics is maintained. Another interesting deviation can be seen in San Jose, where the subscribers are seen using the service throughout the day and not only during peak hours.\n",

    "## Key Insights for Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "> In order to give the overall summary as shown above, the changes adapted to plots were:\n",
    "<br> 1) Using a step type histogram plot to show the duration of rental and usage based on hour of the day with respect to user types and country on a single plot. \n",
    "<br> Making use of different colour gradient for the heatplot to better represent the data\n",
