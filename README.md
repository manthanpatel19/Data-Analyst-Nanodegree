The repository contains projects for Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

### Project 1: Explore Weather Trends
>In this project, we analyze the local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends of one's city with the global temperature trends.

### Project 2: Investigate a Dataset
>In this project, we choose one of Udacity's curated datasets, perform an investigation, and share our findings

### Project 3: Analyze A/B Test Results
>In this project, we work to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Our goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new version of the website or not.

### Project 4: Wrangle and Analyze Data
>In this project, we gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats. We then assess its quality and tideness, then clean it. We then showcase our wrangling efforts.

### Project 5: Communicate Data Findings
>In this project, we choose a dataset (either our own or Udacity's curated dataset) and then perform exploratory data analysis using Python. We then create a presentation with explanatory plots.
